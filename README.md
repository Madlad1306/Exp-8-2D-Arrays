# 2D Arrays in C++ (Matrices)

**AIM:**
To understand and implement the usage of 2D arrays (matrices) in C++.

**SOFTWARE USED:**
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

## THEORY

A **matrix** is a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions in rows and columns. In C++, a matrix is typically implemented using a **two-dimensional (2D) array**, where data is stored in a grid-like structure for easy access and manipulation.

### üîπ Importance of Matrices

* **Engineering** ‚Üí Circuit parameters, stress-strain relationships, transformations.
* **Computer Science** ‚Üí Data tables, image processing, graph representations.
* **Mathematics** ‚Üí Linear equations, transformations, statistics.
* **Physics** ‚Üí Quantum mechanics, kinematics modeling.
* **Data Science** ‚Üí Datasets, correlations, machine learning.

### üîπ Properties of Matrices

* **Order:** Defined as `m √ó n` (rows √ó columns).
* **Square Matrix:** Rows = Columns.
* **Diagonal Elements:** Elements where row index = column index.
* **Symmetric Matrix:** Matrix equal to its transpose.
* **Sparse Matrix:** Contains mostly zero elements (memory-efficient storage).

---

### üîπ Common Matrix Operations

* **Matrix Addition:** Add corresponding elements (requires same order).
* **Matrix Multiplication:** Row √ó Column multiplication (requires compatible dimensions).
* **Transpose:** Convert rows into columns.
* **Diagonal Operations:** Trace (sum of diagonals), product, determinant (for square matrices).

---

### üîπ Relevance in Programming

* Implemented using **static arrays** (fixed size) or **dynamic arrays** (runtime allocation).
* Widely used in:

  * Image/Video Processing (pixel matrices)
  * Cryptography & Security
  * Machine Learning (weights, datasets)
  * 3D Graphics & CAD
  * Network & Graph Theory
